        Smart Spend is a credit card spend management application offering for small to medium sized law firms.

        I led the planning and release of the Alpha version of a new credit card product vertical, which is expected to significantly boost monthly recurring revenue.

        My technical expertise includes enforcing reliable distributed transactions by designing long-running business processes (saga) with NestJS, handling webhooks, SMS, and CRUD operations.

        I streamlined deployments and maintenance of microservices using Docker containers and implemented/debugged Kafka consumer logic in a distributed system.

        I developed robust and reusable React components, including table layouts, forms, and mobile-adaptive cards for NextJS using a Backend-for-Frontend architecture and GraphQL.

        I ensured the reliability of frontend interaction patterns by creating a comprehensive suite of unit and end-to-end tests with Jest and Cypress.

        To maintain high code quality and service reliability, I applied best practices in code review and quality assurance life cycles, along with comprehensive testing practices and CI/CD. I automated the build, testing, and deployment processes of the React app using CircleCI pipelines and GitHub Actions.

        As Technical Lead I improved overall team effectiveness by mentoring other engineers through one-on-ones, tech talks, and hosting office hours, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.
